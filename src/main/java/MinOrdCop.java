2. Closest Numbers
Given an array of distinct integers, determine the minimum absolute difference between any two elements. Print all element pairs with that minimal absolute difference in ascending order.
Example numbers = [6,2,4,101 The minimal absolute difference is 2 and the pairs with that difference are (2,4) and (4,6). When printing element pairs (if), they should be ordered ascending first by i and then by j.
2 4
4 6
Function Description Complete the function closestNumbers in the editor below.
closestNumbers has the following parameter(s): int numbers[al: an array of integers Returns: NONE Prints: distinct element pairs that share the minimal absolute difference, displayed in ascending order with each pair separated by one space on a single line
Constraints
• 1 .1-1105 • -2 x 106 numbers[i] < 2 x 106 • The numbers array contains no duplicate elements.
• Input Format for Custom Testing
Input from stdin will be processed as follows and passed to the function.
The first line contains an integer n, the size of the array numbers. Each of the next n lines contains an integer numbers(i].
♦ Sample Case 0
Sample Input 0
STDIN Function
4 • numbers [] size n = 4 4 • numbers = [4, 2, 1, 3] 2 1 3
Sample Output 0
1 2 2 3 3 4
Explanation 0 The minimal absolute difference between any two elements in the array is 1, and there are three such pairs having this difference: (1, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 4).
